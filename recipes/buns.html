        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>5 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (.25) ounce envelope active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Combine the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan. 
            Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. 
            If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li> 
           <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour and yeast. 
            Pour in wet ingredients and stir until the dough starts to pull together. 
            If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook to mix for about 8 minutes. If not, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes. 
            Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li> 
           <li>Punch down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger than a golf ball. 
            Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly around and pinching it at the bottom. 
            Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. 
            After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. 
            You may want to oil your hand first. Set rolls aside until they double in size, about 20 minutes. </li> 
           <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix together the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water in a cup or small bowl. 
            Brush onto the tops of the rolls. Position 2 oven racks so they are not too close to the top or bottom of the oven. </li> 
           <li>Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the rolls from the oven and return them to different shelves so each one spends a little time on the top. 
            Continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until nicely browned on the top and bottom. </li> 
        </ol>
